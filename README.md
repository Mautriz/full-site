# Full Site

This project is meant to be a learning experience while it might become my personal website (or whatever application I am willing to build) base for the future

## Features

- Authentication and authorization are decoupled from any api, making it easy to add new protected microservices by just adding a rule to oathkeeper while the apis are "dumb" by themselves, just handling their logic and not caring about securing routes, easening the code itself and testing
- Graphql and autogenerated typesafe frontend api calls making use of graphql-codegen and apollo-client
- Websockets and graphql subscriptions
- Frontend might easily become a SSG/SSR/SPA depending on the needs

## Composition

- Client: Svelte application, all frontend needs, including auth pages (related to kratos)
- Server: Rust Graphql api
- Kratos: Handles authorization/redirection/sessions, both oauth and not
- Oathkeeper: Identity and access proxy, determines which routes a user can or cannot use

## Might or might not add in the future

- Ory Keto: fine grained access control for single objects, objects relationship handling
- Decoupled frontend just for auth routes
- Apollo Federation for a single api with multiple microservices
